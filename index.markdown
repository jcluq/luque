I am an artist and maker from Bogota, Colombia with a deep interest in installation, sculpture, physical computation and digital fabrication.

I like to work with perceptually interesting technologies, objects and phenomena by  figuring out ways to transform them into experiences and contraptions that can express what I consider special about the complexity of the world we live in.

I also have experience doing introductory workshops, using strategies to teach about art, electronics, programming and digital fabrication in a horizontal way. I believe the sharing of knowledge is the basis for a better future.
