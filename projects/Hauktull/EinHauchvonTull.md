Project in collaboration with [Lucca Vitters](https://luccavitters.art/) 

Ein Hauch von Tüll is a light installation consisiting of a projected image over 8 layers of tull fabric. Depending on the distance from the projector, each image becomes larger on each of surfaces, creating an increason on the scale of each. By playing with different patterns, an illusion of spatiality and dimentionality emerges, producing a very interesting effect for the eyesight.

For this project, we had the requirement of portability and easy assemblage as a design contrain. This allowed us to transport it to different events and exhibitions. We perfomed as Visual Jockeys on different occasions, using the installation as a display.
