# FRDYER

![Cover](./photos/DSC08678.JPG)



The FRDYER is a musical instrument inspired on the characteristical touchless interaction of the well-known theremin. Similar to the Theremin, the FRDYER relies on the electromagnetic field to operate. An electromagnetic microphone converts the electromagnetic fields into an oscillating signal, thus creating a sound output with a very particular character. This signal is then connected to a microcontroller which modifies the sound by passing it through a  Low Pass filter and then a Feedback Delay. This generates a looping atmospherical sound which can be modified by moving the microphone or adding different electromagnetic sources. 

The name FRDYER is a tribute to Michael Faraday, for his contributions towards the study of electromagnetic fields.
