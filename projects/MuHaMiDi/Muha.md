The BlueTooth MiDi controller is a device prototype capable of sending midi messages over the bluetooth comunication protocol. It is a chargeable device based on the esp32 microcontroller. The current design uses a custom pcb to hold the microconrollers and the interaction buttons together, making an optimal use of the space. 

The device can be adapted to work over WiFi or ESP32 protocol messages, aswell as having the capability to use other communication protocols such as OSC over UDP.
