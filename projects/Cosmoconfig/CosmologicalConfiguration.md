Cosmological Configuration 1 was a in situ light installation made up of 1200 of EL Wire. 

The spectator was presented to a dense light array of lights, on a very dark and soothing enviornment, with the objective to present a space of contemplation towards a sculpture which occupied and changed the room enviornment by the dimming of the lights.

It served as a great research project, as I had the oportunity to learn about pcb manufacture, weilding, spatial thinking, digital fabrication, interaction and microcontrollers. I consider this was a solid step towards what I dream of doing. 

To all of those who helped, even by a little, to bring this piece up, specially on those last 2 weeks, thanks you, this artwork is for all of you.
