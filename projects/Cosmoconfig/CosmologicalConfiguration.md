Cosmological Configuration is an immersive light instalation consisting of Electroluminiscent (EL) Wire sections distributed in space.
The disposition of the wires in a dark space construct the feeling of an enviornment thanks to the light contrast and the lines which intersect. This interaction among the lights build a sensation on the spectator which is encoraged to walk and stay in the place for a duration of time.

The work was built with the idea of understanding and exploring how a -sacred- place create a special disposition for who populates it. The darkness in which the artwork is contained pretends to emulate the sensation of infinity, which contrast with the strings of light. 

The artwork used 1200 meters of EL wire and 3000 meters of copper wire.
